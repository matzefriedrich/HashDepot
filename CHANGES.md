# Changes

## 3.1.0

### Breaking changes
- This version targets .NET 6.0
- Removed APIs that received `byte[]`.
- Removed all unsafe code.
- Removed .NET Standard 2.0 support (sorry, but new .NET is so nice to code, and maintaining #ifdefs is unnecessarily cumbersome)

### Improvements
- Memory use improved in async functions.
- Benchmark now uses BenchmarkDotNet.

## 3.0.0
This release is obsolete and unlisted. Do not use.

## 2.0.3 and previous versions
Lost to the history. JK, check the releases for the change notes on those.
