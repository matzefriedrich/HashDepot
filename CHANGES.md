# Changes

## 3.0.0
This release mostly removes obsolete FNV1 implementation (hence the major version upgrade). It also
includes small performance improvements in the async handling code.

This release also targets .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 6.0 together so you can use the latest version
of this library with .NET Framework.

## 2.0.3 and previous versions
Lost to the history. JK, check the releases for the change notes on those.
